# Fortune-1000-Companies

The dataset features detailed information about the top 1000 American companies, ranked by revenue, based on the Fortune 1000 list published annually by Fortune magazine. It includes key attributes for each company, such as rank, CEO, ticker symbol, sector, industry, market value, profits, and number of employees. The data was compiled by scraping Fortune's website, incorporating both the overall rankings and specific company pages for additional details. This dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of the largest companies in the U.S. for the year 2023 and contains 1000 entries in total.

Fortune magazine publishes this list every year and some lists can be found from different sources. From looking at last year's available datasets, some features were missing or could not be found. The idea was to build a scrapper that includes basic data along with what's included on Company Info (such as CEO, Ticker and website) from the Fortune magazine website.

This year's version of the notebook was just an update to account for changes in the json data structure and, for a few additional figures made available this year (i.e. World's Most Admired Companies).

The html source code from the 2024 fortune 500 Ranking actually includes 1000 companies. A reference page (slug) to additional info is included for each companies which were also scrapped to complete the dataset.
